        <p>LeBron James is one of the most talented, versatile, and dedicated players in NBA history. Since his professional debut in 2003, he has captivated audiences with his power, grace, and tenacity.

Look at the NBA record book, and find the names of players who ever accomplished something on the basketball pitch. The name ‘LeBron James’ appears so much in this book that it can as well be renamed the ‘King James’ book.

LeBron James and Michael Jordan are two of the standout players of their era. Their accomplishments, milestones, and legacies are often debated and discussed.

James is commonly labeled “the greatest basketball player of all-time.” This has led him to be compared to Michael Jordan. In a 2016 Sports Illustrated interview, James said that his ultimate goal is surpassing Jordan as the greatest.

Polls suggest that Jordan is ahead with James coming in second place. In most polls, older voters are choosing Jordan while younger ones are selecting James. According to Sam Quinn of CBS Sports, LeBron James is the best challenger to Jordan’s status as the greatest NBA player of all time.
